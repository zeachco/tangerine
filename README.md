API and scraper for the Tangerine Bank, based off of the Python version by kevinjqiu https://github.com/kevinjqiu/tangerine/

# Install

```shell
npm install tangerine-bank --save
```

# Usage

This module is still under development. Most methods from the Python version have been rewritten to JavaScript, but only login and list accounts has been tested.

## Authentication

Currently only authentication method is by passing an object with the needed login values or a string to a JSON file which contains the files.

```JavaScript
const Tangerine = require('tangerine-bank');

Tangerine.login('login.json').then(result => {
	console.log(result);
});
```

## List Accounts

```JavaScript
const Tangerine = require('tangerine-bank');

Tangerine.login('login.json').then(result => {
	Tangerine.list_accounts().then(result => {
		console.log(result);
	});
});
```

## login.json

```json
{
  "username": "",
  "pin": "",
  "phrase": "",
  "questions": {}
}
```
